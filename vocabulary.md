- `confirm-receipt` - a special kind of entry that verifies that a `member` received it's new `shard`.
- `group-sign-key` - a secret that allows to write to the group feed. the group-sign-key is turned into shards using [Shamirs Secrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing)
- `group-feed` - a feed of `writes`, contains all the writes that were signed, its the same for all clients - the source of truth.
- `client-feed` - a feed of `request`s, contains all the requests, one per `known-client` and it also contains `writes` and `confirm-receipt`.
- `ephemeral` - data that is not persisted but may be communicated between the known peers.
- `outbox` - a set of `ephemeral` data that contains shards used to restore a `group-sign-key` or new `shard`s to be stored by each of the `members`.
- `requestee` - the `member` that initially created the `request`.
- `state` - exposed information of the client through the API. The state exposes information about the `client-state` and `request-state`
